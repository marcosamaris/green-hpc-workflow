This repository brings together scripts and tools to simulate energy consumption in scientific workflows using **WRENCH**. The goal is to help understand how different workflow configurations affect **energy consumption** and the use of **computational resources**.

## Project Objective

Provide a basis for simulating energy consumption in workflows, enabling studies and analyses that contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable strategies.

## Functionality

- Simulation of scientific workflows in **HPC** systems.
- Generation of synthetic workflows with tools such as **Wfcommons**.
- Collection and export of energy consumption metrics in **CSV** format files.

## Used tools

- **WRENCH**: A simulation framework for workflow management systems.
- **Wfcommons**: Tool for modeling and generating synthetic workflows.
- **Python**: For automation and analysis of results.
- **C++**: For simulation development.
- **Docker**: For configuring reproducible environments.

## Pre requisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Docker

## How to Use

### 1. Environment Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feliperafaelbarbosa/energy-consumption-simulator.git
cd energy-consumption-simulator
```

### 2. Workflow Generation
Inside the Docker container, install WfCommons.
Create synthetic workflows using the `wfgenrecipe.py` script located in the `src` folder. THe files will be generated in the `workflows/` directory.

### 3. Project Compilation and Build

Create a folder named `build` in the root of the project, enter the folder, run `cmake ..` and then `make`

### 4. Starting the Simulation

Navigate to the root of the project and run the `start.sh` script. The simulation results will be generated in the `/data` directory.
